# Outboundly

Outboundly is an AI-assisted tool that turns job listings into outbound leads by surfacing hiring companies and contact paths for proactive job seekers.

## Why this exists
Most job seekers apply passively and wait. This project explores how outbound thinking can create better job search outcomes.

## What it does (v0)
- Accepts a job search query
- Returns hiring companies
- Shows basic company context and links
- Enables direct outreach

## What it doesn’t do (yet)
- No authentication
- No saved profiles
- No guarantees on data accuracy

## Status
Early prototype. Built in public while learning AI-first development.
